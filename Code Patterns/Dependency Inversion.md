Dependency inversion is a [[Design Patterns]].

The idea behind dependency inversion is that functions/objects should have their dependencies pushed to them from their caller. This is in opposition to the idea of functions/objects creating/getting their dependencies directly.

This reduces coupling since the function/object will receive whatever the caller gives it. This results in an interface driven [[Code Architecture]].
