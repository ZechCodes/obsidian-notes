[[Server Side Generation]] (SSG), [[Server Side Rendering]] (SSR), and [[Single Page Apps]] (SPAs) are three different approaches to rendering dynamic web pages.

**Server Side Generation (SSG)**
SSG generates pages at build time. So when pages are requested the HTML is already prepared and ready to be served.

**Server Side Rendering (SSR)**
SSR generates pages at request time. So when pages are requested the HTML template is loaded and populated with the most recent content, and then that generated HTML is served.

**Single Page Apps (SPAs)**
SPAs handle page generation on the client. So instead of requesting a page they will request the data they need to populate the necessary template in the browser.
